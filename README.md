CryptoNotifier is a user-friendly Python program designed to streamline the process of tracking cryptocurrency prices and receiving timely notifications when a specific target price is reached. Leveraging the Coingecko API, this program allows users to specify a particular cryptocurrency of interest and set a target price threshold in USD. Once the specified cryptocurrency reaches the predefined target price, the program sends an email notification to the user, ensuring they stay informed and can take appropriate action in a timely manner.

Key Features:

- Utilizes the Coingecko API to fetch current cryptocurrency prices, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

- Users can specify their desired target price for a particular cryptocurrency, enabling personalized notifications tailored to their investment goals.

- Automatically sends email notifications to users when the target price for their chosen cryptocurrency is reached, ensuring prompt awareness and timely decision-making.


CryptoNotifier is provided as-is and does not constitute financial advice. Users are encouraged to conduct their own research and consult with financial professionals before making any investment decisions.


NOTE: Prices are in USD, so if using a different currency convert currencies accordingly.


Updates to increase the efficiency of this program will be made from time to time.
